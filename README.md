# CaseChange Java Program

## Overview
The `CaseChange` program is a simple Java application that converts the case of each character in a given string. Specifically, it converts uppercase letters to lowercase and lowercase letters to uppercase.

## How It Works
- The program processes each character in a given string.
- If the character is an uppercase letter (A-Z), it is converted to lowercase.
- If the character is a lowercase letter (a-z), it is converted to uppercase.
- The converted characters are printed consecutively to form the final output.

## Example
Given the input string `"PriyAnka"`, the output will be:

```
pRIYaNKA
```

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

## How to Run
1. **Compile the Java Program:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `CaseChange.java` file. Then, compile the program using the following command:
   ```
   javac CaseChange.java
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   After compilation, run the program using:
   ```
   java CaseChange
   ```

The program will execute and display the output based on the hardcoded string within the code.

## Customization
To test different strings:
- Modify the `name` variable in the `main` method with your desired string.
- Recompile and run the program to see the case conversion result.
